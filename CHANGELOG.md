# Changelog

Versions of the core and of each library are separate, and follow semantic versioning: from 1.0.0 on, a change that breaks the public API comes only with a new major version.

## 2026-09-15: update notices

Released together with Drag'n Wash Localization v1.1.0. The libraries stay at 1.0.0.

### Core 1.1.0

- Update notices. A mod that names its GitHub repository (`ModInfo.UpdateRepository = "owner/name"`) is checked against the repository's latest release once a day. The Mods screen tags the mod with **Update**, shows the new version and opens its release page, and the title screen says how many updates are available. Nothing is downloaded or changed. Drafts and pre-releases are never offered. Players can switch it off in the framework's settings on the Mods screen (`[Updates] Check for updates`). The framework checks itself the same way.

## 2026-09-15: first release

First release, together with [Drag'n Wash Localization](https://github.com/TomXV/dragnwash-localization) v1.0.0, the first mod built on the framework.

### Core 1.0.0

- Mods screen, reached from the game's Options screen: every BepInEx plugin with its name, version, description, authors, website and icon (`ModFramework.Register(ModInfo)`, or read from the DLL and a Thunderstore manifest), plugins that did not load and why, and preloader patchers.
- On/off switches, applied by the preloader patcher at the next launch; switching off a mod other mods need asks first.
- Settings pages generated from BepInEx config, and rows in the game's own Options screen (`GameOptions`).
- Extension points: service registry (`Services`), health checks for patched game methods (`GameHooks`), extra Mods screen pages (`ModFramework.AddModsPage`), libraries (`ModInfo.IsLibrary`) with the mods that need them and the mods each one uses.
- Detection of game methods patched by more than one mod, shown as a Conflict.
- The title screen shows "Drag'n Wash ModFramework <version>" and how many mods loaded, just above the game's build id, like Minecraft Forge.
- Works with mouse, gamepad and on the Steam Deck: a thin white frame shows the selected item, and A, R2 and the trackpad click press it. The layout follows window resizes and full screen.

### Text 1.0.0

- `GameText.AddRewriter`, `RefreshAll`, `TryGetSource`: see and replace every TextMeshPro text before the game shows it, in an explicit order, and apply the rewriters again after something they depend on changed.

### Dialogue 1.0.0

- `GameDialogue.LineShowing`, `OptionShowing`, `NodeStarted`, `CurrentNode`, `TryGetLine`: the line of dialogue or option about to be shown, with line ID, speaker and node.

### Tool window 1.0.0

- One shared window (F1 by default, `[General] ToggleKey`) where mods add tabs with `ToolWindow.AddTab`. Frees the cursor, blocks game input under the window, turns gamepad and Steam Deck trackpad presses into clicks, and draws with a font that has Japanese and Chinese glyphs. A tab that throws is turned off with its error shown; the other tabs keep working.

### Assets 1.0.0

- `GameFonts`: one fallback font chain for the whole game, prepared per language at startup so Direct3D 12 does not crash. `GameAssets.LoadTexture` and `LoadBundle`, cached per file.

### Flags and saves 1.0.0

- `GameSaves`: save slots, level and flags, edits that snapshot first, restore, and a history of every version in `BepInEx/SaveHistory`. `GameFlags`: the flag catalog from CSV files.
